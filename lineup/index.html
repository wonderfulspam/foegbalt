<p>Over the last decade, C Joynes has ploughed a singular furrow through solo guitar, with a body of work incorporating English folk-tunes alongside North &amp; West African music, and lifting proto-minimalist and improvised techniques from the European classical and avant-garde traditions. He has played extensively across the UK, Europe and the USA, sharing bills with performers including Shirley Collins, Richard Dawson, 75 Dollar Bill, Jack Rose, Sir Richard Bishop, and Six Organs Of Admittance. Joynes’ new release, ‘Poor Boy On The Wire’, is his first full album dedicated wholly to the electric guitar, where he exploits the instrument’s potential by placing intricate parlour compositions alongside overdriven garage blues throw-downs, wiry electric folk and the brittle ringing tones of free improvisation.</p>

    <img src="/assets/img/nianio-roginski.jpg">
<p>Elik sees the musical marriage between ukrainian experimental singer songwriter Svitlana Nianio and polish guitar maverick Raphael Rogiński. Nianio has been active since the late 80s, both in groups like Cukor Bela Smert and solo with various collaborators. Her music draws on aspects of modern composition and traditional and medieval music with the aura of her voice and simplicity of her compositions at the center. Deeply rooted in primeval myths, Svitlanas music creates a world of magic realism, in which the temporal dimension and the other world constantly move and permeate.</p>
<p>Nianio's music saw a major international resurgence in interest during the 2010s, leading to the reissue of some of her albums and a return to public performing beginning in 2015 followed by new music and new collaborations. One of these projects is the duet Elik with Raphael Rogiński.</p>

<p>Jaleh Negari is an Iranian/Danish composer and drummer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Negari works in the field of experimental instrumental- and vocal music, electronic music, percussion and sound art. She has been a key figure in the experimental scene in Copenhagen for more than a decade, exploring her practice as a composer and drummer with a vitality like few others. Her work is incredibly versatile and spans from hip hop groups to performance setups, experimental noise acts and avant-garde composition.</p>
<p>Jaleh Negari appears as a member of the bands Selvhenter and Pinkunoizu and as a part of the dance- and sound performance group Meshes. She is also a founding member of the artist collective and label Eget Værelse (eng: A Room Of One’s Own) along with fellow artists Maria Bertel, Sonja LaBianca, Maria Diekmann and Anja Jakobsen, which has become a platform for acts like Selvhenter, Valby Vokalgruppe and the solo projects of the members.</p>
<p>In 2021 Jaleh Negari released her second solo album Weaver ~, unfolding her work with electronic composition through musical translations of field recordings from travels in Denmark, Indonesia and Iran.</p>

<p>Louis Hardin, better known as MOONDOG, is one of the most unlikely, mythical and persevering composers to come out of New York’s mid century music scene which gave birth to the careers of kindred spirits like Steve Reich and Philip Glass.</p>
<p>Moondog (1916-1999) effortlessly created his own trademark blend with inspirations from Western classical baroque music like Bach, oriental and native american music, jazz and the street sounds of 6th Avenue, where one could often find him standing, dressed in a cloak, selling his poetry, sheet music and recordings. But mainly he was standing on the sidewalk composing, writing his music in braille. Moondog lost his eyes at the age of 16, so day or night did not matter to him. His compositions hold both simple melodic elements and complex rhythms such as 5 and 7, and polyphony in a combination that is both captivating and meditative at the same time.</p>
<p>Percussionist Stefan Lakatos became fascinated by Moondog's music as a teenager and the two met in 1980 and formed a close and fruitful friendship that lasted until Moondog’s death. It seemed only natural that Moondog would pass on his trimba to Lakatos - the unique percussion instrument Moondog designed himself, which serves as the central element in most of his compositions. In this sense, Lakatos is Moondog’s musical living heir and Moondog once labeled him as &quot;the leading exponent of the Moondog method of drumming&quot;, even writing 4 songs specifically for Stefan in the late eighties. He has proudly continued to play this unique music as far afield as Carnegie Hall in New York and the Barbican in London, toured with a group of Indonesian gamelan musicians performing Moondog's compositions at the Unsound Festival in Krakow as well as at Berlin's Berghain. Stefan also leads the quintet The Original Moondog Strings which we dearly hope to present at a later date.</p>
<p>Bengt Tribukait (b. 1964) is an award winning organist, chamber musician and accompanist. A fascination with Bach's music awoke in him early on and he expressed his desire to become an organist at the age of five, however, he devoted his childhood primarily to the piano. From age 15 he took his seat behind the organ and has since toured the world, often in close collaborations with many contemporary composers, and with a keen interest in music from the middle ages onwards. He also plays harpsichord, piano and harmonium.</p>
<p>In this duo format Lakatos and Tribukait will perform a selection of Moondog’s compositions for various keyboard instruments and percussion.</p>

<p>The Malisz family originates in Męcina Mała, a small village in the Beskid Niski region of the Western Carpathians and Multiinstrumentalist Jan Malisz started Kapela Maliszów with his children, Kacper and Zuzanna to continue the family’s rich tradition of music. Jan Malisz was himself taught the basics of a variety of instruments by his father Jozef and today, as well as playing them, he builds violins, hurdy-gurdys, nyckelharpas and pipes in his workshop.</p>
<p>The trio is inspired by traditional music from the Beskid Niski and Pogorze region, where the folk songs and dance music is traditionally played with a violin, a basolia (similar to a cello) and a drum leaving much room for improvisation and freedom. The band’s compositions are characterised by fiery, trance-like mazurkas driven by the precariously proficient violin playing of Kacper, the haunting voice of Zuzanne and the organic improvisatory interplay of a family brought up on music.</p>
<p>They’ve previously performed at Ethniesy Festival, Womex Festival and with our very own friends, Fanø Free Folk Festival.</p>

Against American Primitivism in Eastern Europe Vol. I. A couple of years later Niesner joined his old bandmate and the duo released Tance Neznámé (Unknown Dances) on the Stoned to Death label and contributed to the Imaginational Anthem Vol. X released on Tompkins Square label in 2020.</p>
<p>Focusing solely on acoustic guitars Šimanský - Niesner don’t hide their inspirations from american primitivism and all that follows with nontraditional tunings, bluegrass rhythms and the mantric repetitions found in asian spiritual music.
