<p>Gothenburg is easily one of the most interesting 'scenes' on the current Scandi underground circuit where the confluence between record store Discreet Music and label Förlag För Fri Musik and associates seems to be an endless nexus spawning one highly interesting act after another.</p>
<p>Last year, FoEG presented Arv & Miljö, Blod, Loopsel, and Leda from the Gothenburg scene. This year, we are thrilled to present Amateur Hour. A three-piece with Dan Johansson, Hugo Randulv (both Enhet För Fri Musik) and Julia Bjernelind, who have all played (together) in a slew of Gothenburg acts. 
</p>
<p>Amateur Hour pivots around an experimental, lo-fi DIY approach with excursions into the abstract and industrial, but – unlike many of their co-citizens – they never stray too far off a more traditional core with Bjernelind’s voice as a melodic stronghold. Pitchfork even labeled their recent LP "an hour-long dream pop epic". While we can see why, this is not the layer-upon-layer straight beauty-seeking shoegaze of e.g., My Bloody Valentine. Amateur Hour is much more meandering in comparison. The trio has just released their third LP, Krökta Tankar och Brända Vanor, and though they have been in existence since at least 2016, this will only be their third live show and their first outside Sweden.</p>

<p>Container is the solo project of American-born, London-based musician Ren Schofield, who over the last decade has refined a signature sound combining his background in drumming and lo-fi noise with techno and rhythmic electronics. </p>
<p>Characterized by propulsive beats and a liberal use of distortion, Container forges a playful sonic meld jam-packed with overdriven energy, rock tropes in disguise, screaming synthesizers and grimey basslines. In short, Container is a noisy, groovy beast like no other and has been equally welcomed at club nights, basement shows, electronic festivals, and rock gigs alike - and hence we’ll obviously welcome him at FoEG as well.</p>

<p>Judith Hamann's work encompasses performance, improvisation, electro-acoustic composition, site specific generative work, and micro-tonal systems in a process-driven and embodied practice, that considers the ways sound operates as a subject, object, and actant. As one of Australia’s foremost contemporary-music cellists, Hamann frequently challenges the boundaries of their instruments, whether the cello, voice, or body. In their recent research, Hamann examines the acts of shaking and humming as formal and intimate encounters; interrogates ‘collapse’ as a generative imaginary surface; and considers the ‘de-mastering’ of bodies, both human and non-human, in settler-colonial heritage instrumental practice and pedagogy. </p>
<p>Judith has been working - and thinking - with other artists which has sometimes included people like Marja Ahti, Oren Ambarchi, Joshua Bonnetta, Charles Curtis, Lori Goldston, the Harmonic Space Orchestra, Sarah Hennies, Alvin Lucier, Éliane Radigue, and La Monte Young. Judith’s work has previously been published by labels including Blank Forms, Black Truffle, Another Timbre, and Longform Editions. </p>

<p>Mark Harwood is an Australian artist, musician, performer, writer, event curator and publisher.</p>
<p>He deploys a wide variety of techniques approached with a sense of bypassing the cliches embedded within, in order to coerce a sound world which is simultaneously contemporary, foreign, beautiful, unsettling and engaging. Harwood has released three acclaimed lp's on Kye (USA) and Penultimate Press (UK) and the Astor moniker along with a series of collaborative recordings with Graham Lambkin, Áine O'Dwyer, Timo van Luijk and more. His last two lp’s released under his own name have become more human and personal explorations. The first of which explored the internal psyche whilst the follow up, this years ‘Offering’, is an album of songs about geography and placement and the way people choose to move across the surface of our planet.</p>
<p>His live performances skirt a more performative presentation of his work often incorporating
spontaneous moments of anything from comedy, pathos, songs etc The audience is witness to and subject of an exploration of the human psyche. This is by no means a purely sound based affair.</p>

<p>Nein Rodere is the alias of David Roeder, a music maker, artist and mental health worker based in Berlin. His sounds move from almost-songs to abstraction and back, often relying on ad hoc expression and collages. This approach has been the result of playing in various bands over the last 20 years, many of which worked with loose musical structures or being fully improvisational. </p>
<p>His self released cassettes and his recent LP on Horn of Plenty, adeptly named Catch up with What Party +, ranges from ensemble pieces, bedroom pop and field recordings to improvisations and soft spoken words, where disparate elements are unified by a layered, textural and DIY approach to sound. Indeed, here the whole is something besides the parts and always with something undefinable and distinctly Rodere lurking around.</p>

<p>Sons of Set is a brand new project by FoEG longtimer Raphael Rogiński who tirelessly digs deep into traditional musical cultures from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. He’s previously worked with Jewish culture and music, the Kurpie folklore (with the band Żywizna), the music of Henry Purcell, John Coltrane and much much more, and most recently he’s been on the path of trance music with projects like Hizbut Jámm. </p>
<p>Sons of Set is the next incarnation on this path where Rogiński teams up with Morrocan guitarist and guembri player Mustapha El Boudani. El Boudani, an indigenous Nomad from the village of M'Hamid El Ghizalne, which lies at the gates of the sands of the Sahara, sings in the Hassani language and brings with him the traditions of Gnawa music. Drummer Paweł Szpura (of Polish band Lotto) rounds out the trio. Sons of Set play the music of the desert and refer to traditional songs and melodies, but in welding together their different cultures, they create their very own personal trance-based music.
