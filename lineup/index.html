      <span>Dania (IQ)</span>
    </div>
<p>Born in Baghdad, raised in Tasmania and now based in Barcelona, Dania moves between cultures and continents with her amorphous creative vision directly tied to her transient existence. In her musical practice, Dania is an architect of textured, neo-ambient soundscapes, where she is preoccupied with harmonics and tonality, while exploring both sound and identity.</p>
<p>Her debut album, Foreign Body (released 2023 on Ecstatic recordings), was written and recorded at home in Barcelona, using a 4-track tape recorder. Using vocal looping techniques, modular synthesis and collaged samples of Iraqi musicians and poets from the post-Gulf War era the tracks have been weaved together into a cloud of magnetic drones and soft hypnagogic vocal textures.</p>

      <span>Lenhart Tapes (RS)</span>
    </div>
<p>Get ready for a perfect blend of sophisticated, wild world-noise-ethno-industrial-folk zombie music hailing straight from Belgrade, Serbia. Lenhart Tapes is a one-man-cassette-tape-manipulator known for his striking and unforgettable live performances. Walkmen are his trusted instruments and with them he mixes selected material from his cassette collection on top of groovy rhythmic loops fusing local folk tunes and screechy noises into obscure soundscapes.</p>
<p>As a passionate collector of audio cassettes Vladimir Lenhart has collected everything from field recordings, rare folk music, spoken word and propaganda material. His grandfather was a well known performer of traditional Slovak folk songs in the 1950s. When the project Lenhart Tapes was born in 2010, Vladimir found a way to rediscover and fuse his musical heritage with the noisy music he’d been performing in his formative years.</p>
