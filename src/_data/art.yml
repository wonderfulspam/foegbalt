    - The visual artist, architect and designer is passionate about creating art and spatial experiences in the intersection between space, light, illustration and physical materials. Her piece ‘Daydreaming’ will become part of the visual wonderland you can relish when visiting the festival. ‘Daydreaming’ consists of 26 floating and illustrative disks that reflect and filter the surrounding light, thereby creating poetic plays of light and color which constantly change expression. The illustrations on the discs are painted with watercolor and are inspired by processes and structures in nature and in the universe. Organic landscapes unfurl offering a myriad of associations, from the surface on moons and planets to internal processes on a cellular level: a fascination with the interplay between the organic, changeable and complex in contrast to the simple and strict that always interconnect in Sally Nor's artworks.
