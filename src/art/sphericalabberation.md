<p>Spherical Aberration is the AV project of Ioana Bilea, a producer and visual artist from Transylvania, currently based in Berlin. After spending a big part of her life in lush forests with organic sounds, she decided to bring these audio visual stimulants to life with real-time generative visuals and textural sounds that flow and transform creating a world of their own. She will accompany the program on Friday the 18th at Cirkusbygningen i Vanl√∏se.
