<p>Matei Petrescu, or PM, is a Romanian multidisciplinary artist, shifting from abstract painting towards video mapping, stage design or just full room installation works when coming down from one of Saturn’s rings. His inspiration, in his own words, comes from the Post Meridian times, those moments when bright daylight swirls into night and time seems so ephemeral, when memory kicks in and starts patching up the pieces between clarity, distortion and imagination. Matei is a FoEG regular and we're delighted to have him with us again this year to use his magic on Saturday the 19th at Cirkusbygningen i Vanløse.
