<p>Day one of Festival of Endless Gratitude has kindly been permitted to take place in the midst of the exhibition 8 moons Aria, which is shown from 12.11.2022 - 10.3.2023 at Brønshøj Vandtårn. 8 moons Aria offers a physical sci-fi universe that grasps how the energy and gravitational field of the moon and the sun not only pulls the Earth's water masses, but also affects us humans. An artistic microcosm of sound, light and materiality arises and forms a sensual and contemplative space.</p>

<p>Martha Skou is an interdisciplinary artist who moves freely between auditory and visual worlds. In both an analytical and experimental way, she works with contrasts in colour, form and/or sound. Both through her collaborations and in her solo projects, her idiom is abstract and atmospheric with compositions in spatial formats as well as in two-dimensional media.</p>
