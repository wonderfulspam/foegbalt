<p>MAZE is an installation that defines the transit between two spaces. An archive of materials is combined to create a labyrinth of layers where the analogue and digital rule over each side, created from the textile scape of Cecilie and the projections of Maria.

Cecilie Schou Grønbeck works with things that she finds on the street, in thrift stores or whatever is at hand. This is both based on a principle of sustainability but also to recognize the history that the material already carries with it. With tools such as humour and provocation, she strives to create colourful and chaotic universes that challenge our normative understanding of material value. Maria Meiga is an illustrator and graphic artist that explores the possibilities of combining different craft and printing techniques for the creation of contrasts and textures. Using patterns from organic life forms she can create worlds full of symbolism.
