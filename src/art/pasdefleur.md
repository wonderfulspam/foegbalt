<p>A STONE DROPPED IN A WELL LEAVES MORE THAN AN ECHO is an experimental audiovisual installation investigating the transitions of fluid motion, where words and sounds are combined in a similar symbiotic relationship.</p>

<p>Pas de Fleur is a new spoken word project presented by Mie Møller and Morten Alsinger centered around their shared interests of literature, dark erotica and outsider art. Mie Møller has performed at numerous spoken word venues and has been working with various sound artists. She has been published several times in the journal of The Poetic Bureau and has founded the publishing bureau Oplag. Morten Alsinger has released 3 albums with the soundscape project VERTICAL and has written books and other published texts over the last 20 years.
