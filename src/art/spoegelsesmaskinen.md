<p>At Brønshøj Vandtårn the evening will be accompanied by the light and video artist Rune Brink Hansen aka. Spøgelsesmaskinen. Through low-resolution pixelated animations, he explores memories and dreams of forgotten places, lost things and haunted technology. We’re excited to see his work engaging with the very special surroundings of Brønshøj Vandtårn and the performances of Jon Collin, Marie Eline Hansen and Pavel Milyakov.
