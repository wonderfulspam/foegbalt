From radical reworkings of Henry Purcell and John Coltrane to his improvisational outlets and the folk explorations of traditional Kurpian songs with Żywizna, Polish guitarist Raphael Rogiński easily transgresses musical borders where others might stop. Deeply rooted in Jewish culture, Rogiński has always sought to incorporate it in his art and this has led to a new solo project focusing on Jewish traditionals, which he will present at FoEG.
