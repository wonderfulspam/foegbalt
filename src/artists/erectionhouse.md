<p>There’s something almost disturbingly old school about a band called Erection House in 2022. But make no mistake, this is a fresh new group emerging from the darker corners of the Danish rock scene as we speak, with its members also performing in acts like Gullo Gullo, Urr, Ærekær, Blot & Bot, Broder, Taphos, Lesion, Alucarda and Assegai.</p>

<p>Erection House digs out the early origins of heavy, psychedelic infused rock music and channels it through a relentless and repetitive, hypnotic grind with touches of Brainbombs, Spacemen 3 and Loop. Add a heavy wall of guitars and you’re good for an inner journey to the dark side. Let the light of true black hole rock blind you.
