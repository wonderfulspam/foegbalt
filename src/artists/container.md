<p>Container is the solo project of American-born, London-based musician Ren Schofield, who over the last decade has refined a signature sound combining his background in drumming and lo-fi noise with techno and rhythmic electronics. </p>
<p>Characterized by propulsive beats and a liberal use of distortion, Container forges a playful sonic meld jam-packed with overdriven energy, rock tropes in disguise, screaming synthesizers and grimey basslines. In short, Container is a noisy, groovy beast like no other and has been equally welcomed at club nights, basement shows, electronic festivals, and rock gigs alike - and hence weâ€™ll obviously welcome him at FoEG as well.</p>
