<p>Félicia Atkinson is a visual artist, an experimental musician, a poet and the co-publisher of Shelter Press. For Atkinson, human voices inhabit an ecology alongside and within many other things that don’t speak in the conventional sense: landscapes, images, books, memories, ideas. Making music is a way to animate these other possible voices in conversation with her own, collaging field recording, MIDI instrumentation, and snippets of essayistic language in both French and English.</p>

<p>Atkinson’s works deal with topics of improvisation, deep listening, cut ups, duration, silence and noise, musique concrete, poetic spaces, deserts, forests, animism, abstraction, ambient and language. Her layered compositions tell stories that alternately stretch and fold time and place, stories in which she is the narrator but not the protagonist.</p>

<p>She is currently a PhD researcher in musicology at Rennes 2 University, France, working on the topics of instruments and programs developed by artists and composers through utopian desire. She has performed and exhibited all over the world and released a dozen of records and books, mostly published by Shelter Press.
