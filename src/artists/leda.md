Sofie Herner's, member of Enhet För Musik and Neutral, solo outlet. While Neutral, a duo with fellow Gotherburger Dan Johansson, is experimental guitar rock with nods to both noise rock, post punk, and no wave, it is essentially melodic, even it is does not contain melody... Perhaps a more correct way of phrasing it would be: It is essentially relative easy on the pallet. With Leda that does not seem to constitute a purpose deserving to be served. The recurrent figures of Neutral are abandoned in favor of a vigorous and more free and uncompromising take on experimental guitar music akin to, in a Danish context, long-time FoEG friend Jørgen Teller.
