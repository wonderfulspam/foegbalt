Sofie Herner, also a member of Enhet För Musik and Neutral, is the guitarist behind the solo project Leda. While Neutral, a duo with fellow Gotherburger Dan Johansson, is experimental guitar rock with nods to both noise rock, post punk and no wave. Neutral, though, still seems relatively easy on the pallet compared to Leda. Here the recurrent figures of Neutral are abandoned in favor of a vigorous and more free and uncompromising take on experimental guitar music akin to, in a Danish context, long-time FoEG friend Jørgen Teller. Expect guitars ranging from resonating overdriven riffs to whaling fuzzed out soundscapes.
