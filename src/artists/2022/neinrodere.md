<p>Nein Rodere is the alias of David Roeder, a music maker, artist and mental health worker based in Berlin. His sounds move from almost-songs to abstraction and back, often relying on ad hoc expression and collages. This approach has been the result of playing in various bands over the last 20 years, many of which worked with loose musical structures or being fully improvisational. </p>

<p>His self released cassettes and his recent LP on Horn of Plenty, adeptly named Catch up with What Party +, ranges from ensemble pieces, bedroom pop and field recordings to improvisations and soft spoken words, where disparate elements are unified by a layered, textural and DIY approach to sound. Indeed, here the whole is something besides the parts and always with something undefinable and distinctly Rodere lurking around.</p>
