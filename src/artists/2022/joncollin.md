<p>Jon Collin is a British-born guitarist from Lancashire, who is now living and working in Stockholm. He makes abstract music with acoustic and electric stringed instruments in non-studio locations. The pieces on his most recent LP Bridge Variations (2022) were recorded under some of the many bridges in Stockholm utilizing the amazing reverberations found here in conjunction with his homemade nyckelharpa. For this performance he will use the acoustics of the water tower in a similar approach using a system of body, mind, breath, strings and electricity.</p>

<p>Jon Collin also runs the record label Early Music and his newest album was released on Discreet Music and strengthens his connections to the vibrant Gothenburg scene. His collaborative work includes releases with Demdike Stare, Samara Lubelski and Bill Nace.
