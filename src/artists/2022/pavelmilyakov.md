<p>Pavel Milyakov is a Berlin-based artist also known for his more dancefloor-oriented project Buttechno. When using his birth name Pavel is mostly focused on sonic experiments and artistic collaborations exploring problems of life in the dystopian and desolate areas of the modern world, and the sociological and psychological issues that haunt our society.  Among others, Pavel Milyakov has collaborated with Bendik Giske, Yana Pavlova, and Alex Zhang Hungtai (Dirty Beaches) and he has performed at venues and festivals such as Berghain, Tresor, CTM, Berlin Atonal, and Terraforma.</p>

<p>Pavel originally emerged as part of Moscow's electronic music scene. However, he has relocated to Germany and uses his position as a prominent experimental musician to speak up against the Russian regime and support Ukrainian artists. He no longer collaborates with labels and streaming platforms in Russia. Instead, his releases are available on his Bandcamp, from which all proceeds go to Ukrainian charities.
