<p>Mark Harwood is an Australian artist, musician, performer, writer, event curator and publisher.</p>

<p>He deploys a wide variety of techniques approached with a sense of bypassing the cliches embedded within, in order to coerce a sound world which is simultaneously contemporary, foreign, beautiful, unsettling and engaging. Harwood has released three acclaimed lp's on Kye (USA) and Penultimate Press (UK) and the Astor moniker along with a series of collaborative recordings with Graham Lambkin, Áine O'Dwyer, Timo van Luijk and more. His last two lp’s released under his own name have become more human and personal explorations. The first of which explored the internal psyche whilst the follow up, this years ‘Offering’, is an album of songs about geography and placement and the way people choose to move across the surface of our planet.</p>

<p>His live performances skirt a more performative presentation of his work often incorporating
spontaneous moments of anything from comedy, pathos, songs etc The audience is witness to and subject of an exploration of the human psyche. This is by no means a purely sound based affair.</p>
