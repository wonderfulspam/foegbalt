Matthias Andersson's, member of Enhet För Fri Musik and one of the two owners of Discreet Music, solo project. Arv & Miljö has been rather mecurial, perhaps because Matthias in his own words "tend to grow tired with a certain piece of equipment as soon as I get too comfortable with it". It started out as a noise project, grew into soundscapes, music concrete, and collages, before the project on 2018's brilliant Svensk Sommar I Stilla Frid found its current home in ambient, almost new age, but kraut inspired and cosmic in the vein if the quieter parts of Lord Krishna Von Goloka sans the vocals. This expression was at the same time expanded and refined on last year's Himmelsvind which could just as easily have served as the soundtrack to a current Swedish children's film or an art film from the 70s.
