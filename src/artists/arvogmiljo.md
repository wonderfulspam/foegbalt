Arv & Miljö is the solo efforts of Matthias Andersson, a member of Enhet För Fri Musik and one of the two owners of Gothenburg record store Discreet Music. Arv & Miljö has been ever-changing, perhaps because Matthias in his own words "tends to grow tired with a certain piece of equipment as soon as I get too comfortable with it". Arv & Miljö started out as a noise project, then grew into soundscapes, music concrete, and collages, before the project found it’s current home in some version of ambient on 2018's brilliant Svensk Sommar I Stilla Frid. This current rendition of Arv & Miljö holds inspirations from krautrock and new age with an awareness of the cosmic. This expression was at the same time expanded and refined on last year's Himmelsvind which could just as easily have served as the soundtrack to a current Swedish children's film or an art film from the 70s.
