Sara Czerny and Nicolas Kauffmann have played their part in the Danish underground scene for two decades. Most of their time has been spent together in Family Underground, formed in 2000, and the offspin trio Timeless Reality. Family Underground’s starting point seems to always have been meticulous explorations of dense drones and psychedelic music. From here they’ve worked their way through many corners of experimental music on a wide range of releases that span post-industrial, noise, fuzzed out guitars, heavy electronics and much more. Live, they've earned quite an international reputation for their improvised, multisensory drenching in sound.
