Mariam Rezaei is a composer, turntablist, and researcher redefining the role of the turntable in contemporary music. Fusing hip-hop, noise, and free improvisation, she transforms traditional DJing into a dynamic, experimental art form and the turntable into an expansive instrument. 

Mariam Rezaei previously led experimental arts projects TOPH, TUSK FRINGE and TUSK NORTH, and she has performed internationally with orchestras and collaborated with artists like Joan La Barbara, Mette Rasmussen, Maria Ch√°vez and many others.
