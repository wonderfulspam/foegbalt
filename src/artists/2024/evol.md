What if you could freeze hardcore techno? This is a special site-specific show that delves into the concept of time dilation, stretching, and slowness, as applied to the slimy sonic language of what Roc Jim√©nez de Cisneros and Stephen Sharp call acid mereotopology. 

Through the use of weirdly frozen bass lines and synthetic stabs, the piece captures the listener in a temporal drift, evoking a sense of floating through an expansive void where time itself seems to stretch and bend. A psychedelic carousel of emerging microstructures and catatonic euphoria.
