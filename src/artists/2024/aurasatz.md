Aura Satz is a London-based visual artist whose work encompasses film, performance and sculpture. Satz’s trajectory orbits around two major topics. One involves the art and science of music, sound technology, vibration, and acoustics. The other involves social and political factors, especially issues of gender and the rediscovery of important contributions women have made to the development of technology

At FOEG 2024, we will be screening two of Satz’ films:

<h3>Little Doorways To Paths Not Yet Taken (2016) - 7’33”</h3>
<p>A brief yet intimate venture inside the home studio of Laurie Spiegel that offers insight into the US composer’s studio work and processes.</p>

<h3>Making a Diagonal with Music (2019) - 10’20”</h3>
<p>A short film about the Argentine electroacoustic composer Beatriz Ferreyra, an original pioneer of early musique concrète during the ‘50s and ‘60s.</p>

<p>The film screenings will be followed by a listening session of Satz’ audio piece <i>Dial Tone Drone (2014)</i> featuring Pauline Oliveros and Laurie Spiegel. 14’00’’</p>
