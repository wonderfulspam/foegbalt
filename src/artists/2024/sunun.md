Bristol’s Sunun has a luring command of dials and limbs and drum skins that’s as grounded as it’s mystical - these machines have ghosts in them. People who’ve seen her live have witnessed Sunun’s forest of wires and microphones eeding her 20 channel desk.

She dubs it old-world style, but the results are always forward - drawing from echoes of drum talk, reggae, grime and RnB to make a 22nd century chorus of thousands of years of human feedback.
