Texas-based Craig Clouse, aka Shit and Shine, has been called a genius and a maverick by the Wire. And the Quietus says he’s “uninterested in the self-imposed restrictions of genre.” 

With highly acclaimed releases on Editions Mego, Diagonal, Riot Season, and others, Shit And Shine have wasted no time clearing away the rubbish whilst cutting up their own path towards giddy bass-heavy shape-shifting dance mutations.
