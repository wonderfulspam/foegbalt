<p>Get ready for a perfect blend of sophisticated, wild world-noise-ethno-industrial-folk zombie music hailing straight from Belgrade, Serbia. Lenhart Tapes is a one-man-cassette-tape-manipulator known for his striking and unforgettable live performances. Walkmen are his trusted instruments and with them he mixes selected material from his cassette collection on top of groovy rhythmic loops fusing local folk tunes and screechy noises into obscure soundscapes.</p>

<p>As a passionate collector of audio cassettes Vladimir Lenhart has collected everything from field recordings, rare folk music, spoken word and propaganda material. His grandfather was a well known performer of traditional Slovak folk songs in the 1950s. When the project Lenhart Tapes was born in 2010, Vladimir found a way to rediscover and fuse his musical heritage with the noisy music heâ€™d been performing in his formative years.</p>
