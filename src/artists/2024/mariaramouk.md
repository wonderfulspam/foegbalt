Focusing on her Moroccan-Amazigh heritage as a point of departure, Maria Nørholm Ramouk examines how resources affect the communities we identify with and how this is reflected in their internal social organization. Recurring subject-matters are loneliness, finding security in communities and repetition. 

With personal, historical and cultural symbols, Ramouk invites us into a trustworthy textile landscape at FOEG 2024. The excerpt of the piece <i>N9drou ngharsou chejra (We could plant a Tree)</i> places a protective hand over the entering guests and encourages conversations about care, relational and human interactions, and impact. The work is installed in FOEG’s concert hall.
