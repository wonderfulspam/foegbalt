Zoomachia Group is a music ensemble created by Francesco Cavaliere (Hundebiss, Marionette, NERO) together with Matteo Martino (Canti Magnetici) and Ramona Ponzini (A Silent Place, PFS Japan). 

The group was founded in 2024 to rearrange, with multiple voices, gestures and visual elements, the ”Zoomachia Disc” music fable — a remarkable fable written by Cavaliere about a scribe ant, a prophet cricket and a mummified mantis.
