20_14 is a Copenhagen sublabel of Escho, which also serves as a platform for setting up events with favorites from around the world. 

20_14 shows are about new meetings, framing contrasts and creating a special room for different perspectives in sound. 

Both label and events are curated by drummer Rune Kielsgaard, who has been active in everything from improvisation to experimental music and alternative pop. For this concert at FOEG Kielsgaard will perform alongside two other mainstays of the Copenhagen scene: Francesca Buratelli and Nova Varnrable.
