The founder of the original Festival of Endless Gratitude returns to open FOEG 2024, showcasing the Estey Field Organ Tone Archive with a demonstration that will set the tone for this year’s gathering. 

Drawing from Pauline Oliveros’ Deep Listening traditions, the archive offers an internal psychological journey. Listening to the archive encourages a meditative state and deeper understanding as our individual minds create patterns of the sound. As Oliveros explained, hearing is involuntary, but listening requires awareness.
