In two separate concerts composer Seth Cluett will present pieces from Spiegel’s two seminal releases and beyond.

Laurie Spiegel is one of those rare artists where a programmer’s technical savvy and a composer’s deep melodic intuition seamlessly merge. Though she is recognized as one of America's pioneering and most advanced computer composers, Spiegel's approach is deeply rooted in Bach as well as traditional and folk music. For Spiegel - also a lutenist and banjo player - the computer represents a new kind of folk instrument, which can supplement and extend human abilities.

Spiegel's music has - literally - traveled to the edge of our solar system, when her realization of Johannes Kepler's Harmonices Mundi, was chosen for the Sounds of Earth record aboard the Voyager spacecraft in 1977. Also a computer programmer, software designer and visual artist, she created the music composition software Music Mouse in 1986 as a way for even nonmusicians to create music in an intuitive way.

Seth Cluett is an artist and composer whose work ranges from photography and drawing to video, sound installation, concert music, and critical writing. His work has been presented internationally at venues such as The Whitney Museum, MoMA/PS1, Moving Image Art Fair, CONTEXT Art Miami, GRM, and STEIM.
