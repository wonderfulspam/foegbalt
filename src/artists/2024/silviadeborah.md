Silvia Tarozzi and Deborah Walker share a friendship that evolved into a long-lasting artistic partnership, around improvisation and contemporary experimental creation (Éliane Radigue, Philip Corner, Pascale Criton), with a few forays into Italian new-wave (Offlaga Disco Pax).

With “Canti di guerra, di lavoro e d‘amore,” the duo blends folk music with their contemporary and improvised roots, reinterpreting songs from their youth in rural Emilia. These songs, often sung by female rice field workers, originate from the emancipation of working-class women and the partisan Resistance in WWII.
