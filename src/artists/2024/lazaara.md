Lazaara is a visual artist whose relentlessly divergent works share a playful process of (re)negotiation between living and non-living agencies. At FOEG, her installations will keep eyes wandering along suspended curves and tentacular limbs that recall the continuous flows of reciprocity born in a culture of gratitude.

In Copenhagen, she has found a lovely group of humans with whom she organizes music events, appropriating spaces as momentary laboratories of material iterations and communal action. Outside of venues, her work often attempts to invite collaborations with nature as relational rehearsals of responsibility and care.
