Deirdre Johanna Humphrys is a trained visual artist and psychotherapist. Deirdre’s work comprises art and psychotherapeutic practices, which holds attention on conversation, its time-keeping and framing, and embodied activations of the nervous system, pivoting with Fred Moten and Stefano Harney’s notion of study. Study, where collective performance, reading and making as well as more introverted moves strive to stay in the borders between form, genre and method. 

A three-pronged queered art-heart is offered as a central motif flourishing through new works made for FOEG; flatworks named DRAWS, usually produced on paper, have been scaled up and transposed to Dvala bed sheets. These works can be found hanging out on the staircase, in the entrance at Kildevæld Kulturcenter.
