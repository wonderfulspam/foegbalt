With their distinctive approach and eternal curiosity, the multidisciplinary artist Xenia Xamanek has created a personal and comprehensive sonic universe in constant transformation. 

Xamanekâ€™s musical productions, as well as their live performances embrace unpredictable sounds and genre-fluid expressions in songs and collages with threads of deconstructed reggaeton and eoperreo, art music, pop, and noise.
