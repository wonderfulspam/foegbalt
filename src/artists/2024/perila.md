Perila is a St. Petersburg-born, Berlin-based sound and visual artist, DJ, performer and poet exploring sensitive borderlines and depths of subtle matter. 

Music as a healing and transformative agent; an invitation to open other layers of engagement with reality by means of deep listening, observation, presence and mutual dialogue with an audience.  Her performances and DJ sets are dense and intense narratives drifting through a rich sonic palette immersing a listener into a personal and sensual trip, while delicate poetry and soft voice breathe with a sense of closeness, desire and release.
