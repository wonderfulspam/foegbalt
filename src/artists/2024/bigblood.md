Blending psychedelic folk, experimental rock, and an array of other influences, Big Blood’s music is both diverse and deeply personal. Known for their DIY ethos, they have self-released most of their recordings themselves, often with handmade packaging, while also collaborating with independent labels like Ba Da Bing Records and Feeding Tube. 

Over the years, the band has built a dedicated international cult following and become a mainstay in New England’s underground music scene.
