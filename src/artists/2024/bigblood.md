Blending psychedelic folk, experimental rock, and an array of other influences, Big Blood’s music is both diverse and deeply personal. Known for their DIY ethos, they have self-released most of their recordings themselves, often with handmade packaging, while also collaborating with independent labels like Ba Da Bing Recordsand Feeding Tube. 

Over the years, the band has built a dedicated international cult following and become a mainstay in New England’s underground music scene.
