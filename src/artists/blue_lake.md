Blue Lake started several years ago as a vessel for Jason Dunganâ€™s solo recordings and collaborations, based around an interest in the post-jazz improvised music of the 1970s and 80s, folk and new age music and instrument-building. After a discovery of a traditional zither in a Swedish loppis, Dungan began building a range of multi-string instruments, modeled on the zither but taking elements from the guitar, banjo and koto.

In the past two years, Dungan has recorded and performed solo as Blue Lake, releasing LPs and cassettes. Blue Lake has recently begun performing live with a larger group, which also includes Carolyn Goodwin, Maria Dybbroe, and Nicole Hogstrand. Blue Lake has performed solo or as a band at Momentum (Odense), Den Frie (Cph), Polychrome (Cph), and Menue (Cph).

For FoEG, Blue Lake will play as a quartet, performing a single piece of music that uses the zither as a conducting element to guide an extended improvisation, and the participants will be Jason Dungan (US) on a self-built zither and clarinet, Tomo Jacobson (PL) on upright bass and reeds, Pauline Hogstrand (SE) on viola, and Oliver Laumann (DK) on percussion.
