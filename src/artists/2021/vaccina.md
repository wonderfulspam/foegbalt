Lino Capra Vaccina (b. 1953), a composer and percussionist based in Milan, is one of the true maestros of the extraordinary Italian minimalism. He started his musical career as a member of the pioneering band Aktuala, which developed a hybrid of rock, avantgarde and traditional music from around the world and of the ancient past. This was shortly followed by collaborations with italian superstar Franco Battiato as a percussionist and co-author, before Vaccina went on to create one of the masterpieces of minimalist music and italian psychedelia - Antico Adagio in 1978.

Long out of print Antico Adagio was unearthed and re-released by the Milan-based Die Schactel in 2015, and after that Vaccina has released several new solo and collaborative albums on the Dark Companion label. Vaccina took strong influence from the American strain of minimalism like Philip Glass and Steve Reich but went down a different path to fulfil his vision. Often utilizing vibraphone, marimba, gongs, piano and all sorts of percussion instruments Vaccina creates compositions that lead you into an undefinable realm, so rich in texture, tone and resonance.
In all of Lino Capra Vaccina’s music there is a warmth and elegance present alongside a deep focus on creating a sonic world that matches his ever present high ambitions.
