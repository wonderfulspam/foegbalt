Loopsel is Elin Engstr√∂m (Monokultur, Skiftande Enheter) solo (although, at FoEG Loopsel will perform as a duo). Loopsel's so far only full length album, The Spiral, was recorded for a video installation in Copenhagen in April 2019. Originally released on cassette, Digital Regress is currently taking pre-orders for a third vinyl pressing. The Spiral "manifests fragmented pieces of shimmering guitar, organ, and electronics creating a drifting ambiance that evokes a feeling of distance and mystique". From formless, but never harsh, experiments to beautiful, organic melodies on top of a pulsating beat, part of The Spiral's lure is that everything feels meticulously worked out, yet never contrived.
