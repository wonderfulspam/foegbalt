Louis Hardin, better known as MOONDOG, is one of the most unlikely, mythical and persevering composers to come out of New York’s mid century music scene which gave birth to the careers of kindred spirits like Steve Reich and Philip Glass.

Moondog (1916-1999) effortlessly created his own trademark blend with inspirations from Western classical baroque music like Bach, oriental and native american music, jazz and the street sounds of 6th Avenue, where one could often find him standing, dressed in a cloak, selling his poetry, sheet music and recordings. But mainly he was standing on the sidewalk composing, writing his music in braille. Moondog lost his eyes at the age of 16, so day or night did not matter to him. His compositions hold both simple melodic elements and complex rhythms such as 5 and 7, and polyphony in a combination that is both captivating and meditative at the same time.

Percussionist Stefan Lakatos became fascinated by Moondog's music as a teenager and the two met in 1980 and formed a close and fruitful friendship that lasted until Moondog’s death. It seemed only natural that Moondog would pass on his trimba to Lakatos - the unique percussion instrument Moondog designed himself, which serves as the central element in most of his compositions. In this sense, Lakatos is Moondog’s musical living heir and Moondog once labeled him as "the leading exponent of the Moondog method of drumming", even writing 4 songs specifically for Stefan in the late eighties. He has proudly continued to play this unique music as far afield as Carnegie Hall in New York and the Barbican in London, toured with a group of Indonesian gamelan musicians performing Moondog's compositions at the Unsound Festival in Krakow as well as at Berlin's Berghain. Stefan also leads the quintet The Original Moondog Strings which we dearly hope to present at a later date.

Bengt Tribukait (b. 1964) is an award winning organist, chamber musician and accompanist. A fascination with Bach's music awoke in him early on and he expressed his desire to become an organist at the age of five, however, he devoted his childhood primarily to the piano. From age 15 he took his seat behind the organ and has since toured the world, often in close collaborations with many contemporary composers, and with a keen interest in music from the middle ages onwards. He also plays harpsichord, piano and harmonium.

In this duo format Lakatos and Tribukait will perform a selection of Moondog’s compositions for various keyboard instruments and percussion.
