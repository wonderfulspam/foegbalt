Hailing from outside Rotterdam, quartet Lewsberg rose to underground prominence following heralded live performances and their acclaimed self titled 2018 debut, which drew Velvet Underground comparisons. While there is something to the comparison – sparingly plucked guitar, snarly tambourine, the occasional violin solo and all – their arty, lo-fi college rock rumble is a vehicle for solid songwriting with an ethos to tirelessly perform their cyclical songs without ever veering off track. Counterculture and college rock, perhaps a hint of Pixies, mixed with (post) punk nihilism makes for one kickingly strong cocktail when served up live.
