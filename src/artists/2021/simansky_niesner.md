Jakub Šimanský and Tomáš Niesner have been friends for over twenty years and shared the stage in bands like Vlněna, Fotbal and the noise rock band Unna. Some years ago Šimanský picked up the acoustic guitar and released his debut solo record Face to Face
Against American Primitivism in Eastern Europe Vol. I. A couple of years later Niesner joined his old bandmate and the duo released Tance Neznámé (Unknown Dances) on the Stoned to Death label and contributed to the Imaginational Anthem Vol. X released on Tompkins Square label in 2020.

Focusing solely on acoustic guitars Šimanský - Niesner don’t hide their inspirations from american primitivism and all that follows with nontraditional tunings, bluegrass rhythms and the mantric repetitions found in asian spiritual music. But Šimanský - Niesner also add their own dash of czech country-folk romanticism to the mix.
