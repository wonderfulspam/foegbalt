Drummer and composer Anders Vestergaard is a highly original voice in the Danish underground music scene. He is active in a number of different acts from the explosive free jazz variant of Yes Deer to the more dynamic and melodic music of Girls in Airports. As a solo artist AV has released two albums; the latest "Prime Float // Unitary Perfect" was released on Anyines in 2018 and features two long stretches of ceremonial and physical drumming. His live performances are characterized by an intense physical presence and a movement towards the transcendence of body and space.
