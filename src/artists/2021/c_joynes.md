Over the last decade, C Joynes has ploughed a singular furrow through solo guitar, with a body of work incorporating English folk-tunes alongside North & West African music, and lifting proto-minimalist and improvised techniques from the European classical and avant-garde traditions. He has played extensively across the UK, Europe and the USA, sharing bills with performers including Shirley Collins, Richard Dawson, 75 Dollar Bill, Jack Rose, Sir Richard Bishop, and Six Organs Of Admittance. Joynes’ new release, ‘Poor Boy On The Wire’, is his first full album dedicated wholly to the electric guitar, where he exploits the instrument’s potential by placing intricate parlour compositions alongside overdriven garage blues throw-downs, wiry electric folk and the brittle ringing tones of free improvisation.
