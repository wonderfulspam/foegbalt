Copenhagen/Mayhem/Posh Isolation-raised Frederikke Hoffmeier’s solo project Puce Mary has been one of the most prolific musical projects of the past decade, constantly poking around in the unsettling wasteland between noise, industrial and drone. Her sound has evolved over the years growing ever more intense and determined, culminating (so far) in 2018’s “The Drought”, a perfect marriage of tight control over modular synths and Hoffmeier’s piercing voice. The days are short and dark right now and there is no better soundtrack for that than Puce Mary.
