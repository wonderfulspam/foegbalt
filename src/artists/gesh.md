<p>Gesh is a new project by composers/musicians Jaleh Negari and Maria Bertel, both co-founders of the collective Eget Værelse and sharing duties in the noise rock band Selvhenter. Utilizing drum kit, synthesizers and amplified trombone this powerhouse duo works its way through long swathes of sound standing on pillars of krautrock, drone and noise.</p>

<p>Both are well down the path of their own solo careers. Besides her solo work Bertel has also performed in groups like G.E.K., Jooklo Danish Group, Valby Vokalgruppe and The BIG Yes. Negari holds a master’s degree in composition from RMC and has released two critically acclaimed solo albums while also taking a seat in the performance group Meshes and the art projekt Fungal Network.
