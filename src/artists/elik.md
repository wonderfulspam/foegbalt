Elik sees the musical marriage between ukrainian experimental singer songwriter Svitlana Nianio and polish guitar maverick Raphael Rogiński. Nianio has been active since the late 80s, both in groups like Cukor Bela Smert and solo with various collaborators. Her music draws on aspects of modern composition as well as traditional and medieval music, with the aura of her voice and simplicity of her compositions at the center. Nianio's music saw a major international resurgence in interest during the 2010s, leading to a return to public performing and followed by new music and new collaborations. One of these projects is the duet Elik with Raphael Rogiński.
