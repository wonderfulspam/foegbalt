<p>Sewer Election is the moniker for multi-instrumentalist, Gothenburg-usual, and Enhet För Fri Musik member Dan Johansson's solo noise, industrial, and experimental electronic music vehicle. Dan has a long background in the Swedish experimental music scene with strong ties to labels like Discreet Music, Förlag För Fri Musik and iDEAL, while he is also active in bands like Amateur Hour,  Enhet för Fri Musik and Neutral.</p>

<p>
Sewer Election brings forth a unique power to transfer hopelessness into sound. On the output of more than 30 releases and a ton of collaborations, EPs and the likes the music ranges from dreamlike and introspective tape loops, musique concrete-esque abstractions and amplified body sounds to full-on nasty harsh noise and challenging sound experiments – usually wrapped in cut-and-paste, black-and-white Xeroxed covers. We do not know what exactly a sewer election is, but, regardless, the name seems to fit the project brilliantly.
