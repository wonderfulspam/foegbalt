<p>Judith Hamann's work encompasses performance, improvisation, electro-acoustic composition, site specific generative work, and micro-tonal systems in a process-driven and embodied practice, that considers the ways sound operates as a subject, object, and actant. As one of Australia’s foremost contemporary-music cellists, Hamann frequently challenges the boundaries of their instruments, whether the cello, voice, or body. In their recent research, Hamann examines the acts of shaking and humming as formal and intimate encounters; interrogates ‘collapse’ as a generative imaginary surface; and considers the ‘de-mastering’ of bodies, both human and non-human, in settler-colonial heritage instrumental practice and pedagogy. </p>
<p>Judith has been working - and thinking - with other artists which has sometimes included people like Marja Ahti, Oren Ambarchi, Joshua Bonnetta, Charles Curtis, Lori Goldston, the Harmonic Space Orchestra, Sarah Hennies, Alvin Lucier, Éliane Radigue, and La Monte Young. Judith’s work has previously been published by labels including Blank Forms, Black Truffle, Another Timbre, and Longform Editions. </p>
