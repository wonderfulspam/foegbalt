<p>As one of Australia’s foremost contemporary-music cellists, Judith Hamann frequently challenges the boundaries of their instruments, whether the cello, voice, or body. Hamann's work encompasses performance, improvisation, electro-acoustic composition, site specific generative work, and micro-tonal systems in a process-driven and embodied practice, that considers the ways sound operates as a subject, object, and actant. </p>
<p>Judith has been working - and thinking - with other artists which has sometimes included people like Marja Ahti, Oren Ambarchi, Joshua Bonnetta, Charles Curtis, Lori Goldston, the Harmonic Space Orchestra, Sarah Hennies, Alvin Lucier, Éliane Radigue, and La Monte Young. Needless to say we are openly excited to present Judith Hamann in what will beyond doubt be a very special performance. </p>
