<p>Longtime FoEG favorite Marie Eline Hansen is one of a kind on the Danish music scene. She works alone merging folk and electronic music – except when she lends herself to worthy collaborations, such as Træning, “Mit Nye Band”, The Bleeder Group and lately SVIN and Yahowa. In her own words Marie Eline plays music to inspire people - especially insecure young ladies - to dare to be imperfect and learn to express themselves freely, in the various vaults of emotion.</p>

<p>On 'Agnostic Hymns' from 2017, she interpreted the very concept of "hymn", songs about life, death, light, music and love. Indeed her music often has a hymnlike character and in that regard a huge cathedral designed for water might be the perfect setting to experience the sincere brilliance of Marie Eline’s songs.
