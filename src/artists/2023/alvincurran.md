<p>In his own words, Alvin Curran, born 1938 in Providence RI, (USA) has since the age of 5 continued to make music with all sounds, in all places, with all people, at all times. After 60 years of composing, performing, releasing records and pushing boundaries, it seems fair to say that Alvin Curran is one of those singular artists who always seems to be not just one but two or three steps ahead of their time.</p>
<p>As a co-founder of the radical music collective MUSICA ELETTRONICA VIVA (with Frederic Rzewski and Richard Teitelbaum) Curran crossed musical territories and blurred the lines between composed and improvised music - a path he further explored on his highly influential (and now minimalist classics) solo records of the 70s like Songs and Views of the Magnetic Garden and Fiori Chiari, Fiori Oscuri.</p>
<p>Alvin Curran's music-making embraces all the contradictions (composed/improvised, tonal/atonal, maximal/minimal) in a serene dialectical encounter and in a volatile mix of lyricism and chaos, structure and indeterminacy, fog horns, fiddles and fiddle heads. His more than 200 works feature everything from taped/sampled natural sounds, piano, synthesizers and computers to violin, percussion, accordion and chorus.</p>
<p>Whether in the intimate form of his well-known solo performances, or pure chamber music, experimental radio works or large-scale site-specific sound environments and installations, all forge a very personal language gathered from all the languages through dedicated research and recombinant invention.</p>
<p>But maybe more than anything else, Alvin Curran is dedicated to the restoration of dignity to the profession of making non-commercial music as part of a personal search for future social, political and spiritual forms. In other words, itâ€™s difficult to think of a more vigorously inspirational artist to present at FoEG.</p>
