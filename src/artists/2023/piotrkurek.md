<p>Hailing from the musical hotbed of Warsaw, the Polish multi-instrumentalist and composer Piotr Kurek creates vibrant, hypnotic music often revolving around the captivating allure of the human voice.</p>
<p>Like a sonic alchemist of sorts, Kurek weaves an intricate tapestry of synthesis and vintage electronics, vocals and acoustic instruments on a bed of a diverse range of influences - from baroque and renaissance music to musique concrete, krautrock and psychedelic music.</p>
<p>Occasionally composing for film and theatre, Kurek already has a diverse output on his resume, with music released by Hands In The Dark, Black Sweat Records, Dunno, Sangoplasmo and other labels. His latest record, Smartwoods, has just been released on Unsound. But whether he's delving into ominous soundscapes, pulsating synth lines or uncanny and otherworldly vocal arrangements, Kurekâ€™s gentle signature is present with an adept sense of combining melody and mystery in uncharted territory.</p>
