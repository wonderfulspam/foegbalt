<p>Beyond merely resurrecting ancient, bloody myths, Lukas De Clerck uses every single breath to give the aulos a different kind of renaissance, where its penetrating and alluring qualities have been excavated to pave new grounds in the practices of old.</p>
<p>The aulos is an ancient-Greek double reeded double pipe which went extinct more than a millennium ago. Inevitably auto-didact and equipped with the artful sense of devotion, De Clerck has dug deep into the technical and cultural peculiarities of this long-silenced instrument. Under the moniker Bloedneus & de Snuitkever he has released several albums of disorienting hymns and improvised sound worlds.</p> 
<p>As legend has it the Satyr Marsyas, playing the aulos, challenged Apollo to a musical contest. Apollo and his lyre beat Marsyas and celebrated his victory by stringing his opponent up from a tree and flaying him alive.</p> 
<p>While weâ€™re not hoping for any blood on stage, we do expect nothing less than myth-shattering, pure blasts of sound that will rejuvenate both body, mind and soul. </p>
