<p>Inspired by drawings from a handbook about calisthenics and gymnastics (published in 1864!) Institute for Certified Nomadic Illicit Sonic Practices came up with a series of musical exercises to stay healthy and fit during the continuous lockdowns over the past few years. These exercises later turned into their debut album released earlier this year.</p>

<p>Consisting of Marina Cyrino and Matthias Koole, both originally from Brazil but now based in Berlin, Institute for Certified Nomadic Illicit Sonic Practice play an energetic mix of electric and acoustic free music. With their primary instruments - guitar and various flutes - often manipulated, the duo’s music reveal completely new sides of otherwise well-tried instruments, where sonic perspectives are shifted and instrumental identities displaced. Throw the calisthenics in the mix and you’re in for some deeply nourishing sonic exercises.</p>
