<p>Annea Lockwood/A Film About Listening is a short film by Oscar nominated director Sam Green. It is an intimate portrait of New Zealand-born American pioneering experimental composer and musician Annea Lockwood that gives a glimpse into the enthralling world of sound that she has been creating and exploring for more than 50 years.</p>
<p>A lifelong friend of fellow composer and ‘deep listener’ Pauline Oliveros, Annea Lockwood has for decades studied how sound can have profound effects on attentive listening bodies. Her work ranges from concert music, featuring prepared piano, glass, and other instruments, to surrealistic performance art, field recordings of natural found sounds, and multimedia installations.</p>
<p>Lockwood’s deep affection for all things water-related is evident throughout her catalog. Her attention to performance works focused on environmental sounds and life narratives began in the 1970s and ’80s with World Rhythms and A Sound Map of the Hudson River. A Sound Map of the Danube weaves field recordings of the rivers with recorded stories of the people living and working on the water.</p>
<p>This film is the perfect way to tune into Saturday’s program at FoEG. Not only is it a warm and heartfelt insight into one of the most interesting experimental artists, it is also a movie that calms you and sharpens your senses. Highly recommended for anyone interested in “deep listening” and the positive effects it can have.</p>
