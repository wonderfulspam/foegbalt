<p>Grev Trold is nothing short of a one-man dungeon black metal band from the south eastern part of Jutland. The band has been aptly named after Grev Trolle, a local pirate known for his brutality and the protagonist of a legend featuring extraordinary cunningness, family revenge and cut-off heads. Like most pirates, Grev Trolle was both an integrated part of early capitalist history and at the same time a figure of resistance and transgressing standard capitalist ventures. </p>
<p>While 'Offerbugten' is the debut of a new project, it is far from the first time the artist behind it has gone to this place for a cathartic outlet, with dungeon synth project Henbane and the black metal of Sei√∞r being closely related. Featuring chilling shrieks and frenetic guitar bursts, the deranged sounds of Grev Trold descend into eerie feverish hallucinations about brutality and sacrifices in a cold distant mythological past.</p>
