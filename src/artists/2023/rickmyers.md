<p>Hailing from Manchester, Rick Myers now resides just a stone's throw away from FoEG’s very own city of birth; Brattleboro in Vermont. Here Myers delves deep into simple concepts, inviting any curious mind to explore alongside him through his hyper-intimate books, sound editions, visual art and captivating performances - from groundbreaking sound collaborations with Andy Votel, Sean Canty, and Matt Krefting to his audacious attempt to complete the legendary filmmaker Luis Buñuel’s project of creating a bullet possessing such a weak charge that it would simply bounce off the filmmaker’s shirt when fired at him.</p>
<p>Rick Myers has graced solo exhibitions at The National Poetry Library at Southbank Centre and Printed Matter, and he has performed and screened videos at institutions such MoMA Library and Whitechapel Gallery while his artist books and interdisciplinary project archives are part of the permanent collections at Library of Congress, Harvard University, MoMA, Tate Britain and many other prestigious institutions.</p>
