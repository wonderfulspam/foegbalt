<p>Moundabout is a new folk project based in Ireland by Paddy Shine, of psychedelic powerhouse GNOD (who performed at FoEG back in 2017), and Phil Masterson, of cult groups Los Langeros, Damp Howl and Bisect. A couple of years ago the duo set out to explore a new form of psychedelic Irish folk music where the listener is invited to see folk as a continuum stretching way back beyond the revival of the 1950s and 1960s to an eternal vibrancy that predates classical antiquity and Irish civilisation itself.</p>
<p>With a backdrop of the Galtees, Ireland's highest inland mountain range, the duo recently recorded their second album, An Cnoc M​ó​r, with a set up of guitars, vocals, old analogue synths and a sparse electronic accompaniment from an antique Hammond drum machine, which Shine found in his auntie’s attic. Getting lost in liminal zones, at thresholds, where boundaries merge,
the pair seek to push even further out than ever before where folk meets free psych music.</p>
