<p>Although DJ Marcelle has been collecting music longer than most of us have been alive, she still feels like The Netherlandsâ€™ sweetheart. Sheâ€™s an artist with a mischievous, rule-bending and almost ironic approach to her DJing, producing and radio hosting â€“ cut with her trademark wit yet supported by an unquestionable amount of skill.</p>
<p>Well known for her three-turntable setup, DJ Marcelle makes compositions out of songs and symphonies out of mixes â€“ colliding disparate genres, appropriated vocal snippets and warped soundscapes into a giant Frankenstein-like melting pot. </p>
<p>Having a dÃ©jÃ  vue? ðŸ‘€  DJ Marcelle was supposed to play at FoEG in 2021 but unfortunately had to cancel. Therefore weâ€™re absolutely thrilled to invite her for a second time to close this yearâ€™s festival with a massive dance party.</p>
