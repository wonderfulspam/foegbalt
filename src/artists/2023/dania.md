<p>Born in Baghdad, raised in Tasmania and now based in Barcelona, Dania moves between cultures and continents with her amorphous creative vision directly tied to her transient existence. In her musical practice, Dania is an architect of textured, neo-ambient soundscapes, where she is preoccupied with harmonics and tonality, while exploring both sound and identity.</p>

<p>Her debut album, Foreign Body (released 2023 on Ecstatic recordings), was written and recorded at home in Barcelona, using a 4-track tape recorder. Using vocal looping techniques, modular synthesis and collaged samples of Iraqi musicians and poets from the post-Gulf War era the tracks have been weaved together into a cloud of magnetic drones and soft hypnagogic vocal textures.</p>
