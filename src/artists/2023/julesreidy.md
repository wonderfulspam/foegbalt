<p>Jules Reidy originally headed to the German capital for a short break from their jazz guitar studies in Sydney, but was electrified by the Berlin scene and have now been living there for almost a decade, a period in which they have undergone a process of musical reorientation.</p>
<p>In their approach, Reidy could be said to be re-imagining a DIY indie aesthetic with an emphasis on techniques usually reserved for classical minimalism. Surreal auto-tuned vocals, strummed strings in just intonation and dubby delays create vast spheres of sounds on top of each other, while delicately picked twelve-string guitars in the midst emphasize the subtlety of their compositions with a rare, open-hearted emotional honesty.</p>
<p>Recent records include In Real Life (Black Truffle, 2019), Vanish (Editions Mego, 2020) and World in World (Black Truffle, 2022), Their newest solo record, Trances, is set to be released via Shelter Press in October 2023. Jules Reidy also performs in various duo formations, and is a member of Oren Ambarchiâ€™s band Carpe Diem.</p>
