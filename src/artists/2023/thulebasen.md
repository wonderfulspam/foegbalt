<p>Refining the art of spontaneous composition since the mid 00s, Thulebasen is a 3-piece band with familiar faces from the Copenhagen scene at the helm. After a long hiatus, Nis Bysted, Niels Kristian Eriksen and Felia Gram-Hansen reappeared this summer at Bades√∏en Festival to bring their unpredictable avant-rock back on stage for the first time in several years. </p>
<p>Just like the original Thule Base (now renamed to Pituffik Space Base), located far up the North-Western part of Greenland, the band find themselves at the remote borders of known and unknown territory, with a closely tuned, all-channels-open approach and a zen-like musical communication between the three members.</p>
<p>Thulebasen strikes a perfect balance between utilizing their deep knowledge of music history, letting curious minds roam free and deploying tightrocking riffs, purehearted melodies and kickass grooves just at the right moment. A FoEG-approved cocktail in other words.</p>
