<p>Artist Barbara Amalie Skovmand Thomsen has been working with many different media like photography, video, poetry, installations, and performance. The central approach in her work has been to seek tactile ways to express a sense of cohesion and belonging to the world. This has been very apparent in her latest endeavors as well, creating sophisticated sound sculptures inspired by the two visionary French Baschet brothers in collaboration with Rafael Fernández and Martí Ruiz.</p>
<p>Skovmand has built several of these instruments, and for her opening performance at FoEG, she will present her latest creation: the Ctenophora, an angelic sound sculpture, which resembles a kind of acoustic synthesizer. Vibrations are created by rubbing glass with watery fingers, which are then channeled towards large screens made of mirror-polished stainless steel, enhancing and distorting the sound. Drawing inspiration from our closest planktonic ancestors – a gelatinous predator, the comb jellyfish or Ctenophora, which has survived the five major mass extinctions – Barbara Skovmand's newest work conjures up a new atmospheric world of spherical tones. </p>
