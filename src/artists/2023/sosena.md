<p>The begena, a 10 string Ethiopian bass lyre, is one of the worldâ€™s oldest and most beguiling instruments with an ambiguous origin story, why it also carries the name The Harp of David. Since ancient times it has been employed as an aural balm and a soother of evil, anxious spirits to calm them down.</p> 
<p>Sosena Gebre Eyesus is one of the most enthralling practitioners of the begena, with her trance-inducing harp playing, which found its way to a stunning album released by Little Ax Records in 2018. Accompanied by the low, buzzing strings, Eyesus performs her devotional Ethiopian hymns with a soft, soothing and utterly beautiful voice filling the void between the World of the living and the dead. Extremely rare in concert this is not to be missed!</p>
