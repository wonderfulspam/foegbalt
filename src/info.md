<h2>COMMUNITY DINNER</h2>
<p>We invite you all to join the first FoEG community dinner on Saturday at 6pm. On the menu is vegan lasagna served by Madglad. This will be a great possibility to connect with all the others around you and become part of the FoEG-family.</p>

<p>Please buy your foodticket in advance at <a href="https://billetto.dk/ticket_buyer/offers/4e5095f3-ba07-41a4-a4da-cd4770ce2a46">Billetto</a>. The foodticket is only valid in combination with a partout ticket or a one day ticket for Saturday. Unfortunately it is not possible to get access to the festival just for the dinner. The food is vegan, but we’re not able to take account for other dietary restrictions.</p>

<p>You will be able to buy food Friday at the festival as well. The food is served from Madglad in Vesterbro.</p>
