<p>Every year, Festival of Endless Gratitude (FOEG) assembles a diverse array of musicians and artists who seek to push the boundaries of contemporary music. The festival spotlights innovative, experimental and emerging sounds as well as overlooked traditions and genres, celebrating the richness of musical expression in all its forms.</p>

<p>In addition to the musical programming, the festival cultivates a space for exploration and experimentation across various formats and media, incorporating elements such as film screenings, community dinners, art installations, poetry readings and artist talks.</p>

<p>A community-driven event, the annual festival is organized by a passionate group of volunteers and draws a vibrant community of local and international music enthusiasts that foster an atmosphere of openness and inclusivity at the festival space.</p>

<p>FOEG originated in Brattleboro, Vermont in 2007, but the festival found its new home in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2009 where it has been held ever since. Festival of Endless Gratitude functions as a non-profit organization.</p>
