<h2>Dania (IQ)</h2>
<p>Born in Baghdad, raised in Tasmania and now based in Barcelona, Dania moves between cultures and continents with her amorphous creative vision directly tied to her transient existence. In her musical practice, Dania is an architect of textured, neo-ambient soundscapes, where she is preoccupied with harmonics and tonality, while exploring both sound and identity.</p>
<p>Her debut album, Foreign Body (released 2023 on Ecstatic recordings), was written and recorded at home in Barcelona, using a 4-track tape recorder. Using vocal looping techniques, modular synthesis and collaged samples of Iraqi musicians and poets from the post-Gulf War era the tracks have been weaved together into a cloud of magnetic drones and soft hypnagogic vocal textures.</p>

<h2>DJ Marcelle (NL)</h2>
<p>Although DJ Marcelle has been collecting music longer than most of us have been alive, she still feels like The Netherlandsâ€™ sweetheart. Sheâ€™s an artist with a mischievous, rule-bending and almost ironic approach to her DJing, producing and radio hosting â€“ cut with her trademark wit yet supported by an unquestionable amount of skill.</p>
<p>Well known for her three-turntable setup, DJ Marcelle makes compositions out of songs and symphonies out of mixes â€“ colliding disparate genres, appropriated vocal snippets and warped soundscapes into a giant Frankenstein-like melting pot. </p>
<p>Having a dÃ©jÃ  vue? ðŸ‘€  DJ Marcelle was supposed to play at FoEG in 2021 but unfortunately had to cancel. Therefore weâ€™re absolutely thrilled to invite her for a second time to close this yearâ€™s festival with a massive dance party.</p>

<h2>Institute for Certified Nomadic Illicit Sonic Practices (BR)</h2>
<p>Inspired by drawings from a handbook about calisthenics and gymnastics (published in 1864!) Institute for Certified Nomadic Illicit Sonic Practices came up with a series of musical exercises to stay healthy and fit during the continuous lockdowns over the past few years. These exercises later turned into their debut album released earlier this year.</p>
<p>Consisting of Marina Cyrino and Matthias Koole, both originally from Brazil but now based in Berlin, Institute for Certified Nomadic Illicit Sonic Practice play an energetic mix of electric and acoustic free music. With their primary instruments - guitar and various flutes - often manipulated, the duoâ€™s music reveal completely new sides of otherwise well-tried instruments, where sonic perspectives are shifted and instrumental identities displaced. Throw the calisthenics in the mix and youâ€™re in for some deeply nourishing sonic exercises.</p>

<h2>Lenhart Tapes (RS)</h2>
<p>Get ready for a perfect blend of sophisticated, wild world-noise-ethno-industrial-folk zombie music hailing straight from Belgrade, Serbia. Lenhart Tapes is a one-man-cassette-tape-manipulator known for his striking and unforgettable live performances. Walkmen are his trusted instruments and with them he mixes selected material from his cassette collection on top of groovy rhythmic loops fusing local folk tunes and screechy noises into obscure soundscapes.</p>
<p>As a passionate collector of audio cassettes Vladimir Lenhart has collected everything from field recordings, rare folk music, spoken word and propaganda material. His grandfather was a well known performer of traditional Slovak folk songs in the 1950s. When the project Lenhart Tapes was born in 2010, Vladimir found a way to rediscover and fuse his musical heritage with the noisy music heâ€™d been performing in his formative years.</p>

<h2>Lukas De Clerck (BE)</h2>
<p>Beyond merely resurrecting ancient, bloody myths, Lukas De Clerck uses every single breath to give the aulos a different kind of renaissance, where its penetrating and alluring qualities have been excavated to pave new grounds in the practices of old.</p>
<p>The aulos is an ancient-Greek double reeded double pipe which went extinct more than a millennium ago. Inevitably auto-didact and equipped with the artful sense of devotion, De Clerck has dug deep into the technical and cultural peculiarities of this long-silenced instrument. Under the moniker Bloedneus & de Snuitkever he has released several albums of disorienting hymns and improvised sound worlds.</p> 
<p>As legend has it the Satyr Marsyas, playing the aulos, challenged Apollo to a musical contest. Apollo and his lyre beat Marsyas and celebrated his victory by stringing his opponent up from a tree and flaying him alive.</p> 
<p>While weâ€™re not hoping for any blood on stage, we do expect nothing less than myth-shattering, pure blasts of sound that will rejuvenate both body, mind and soul. </p>

<h2>Rick Myers (UK)</h2>
<p>Hailing from Manchester, Rick Myers now resides just a stone's throw away from FoEGâ€™s very own city of birth; Brattleboro in Vermont. Here Myers delves deep into simple concepts, inviting any curious mind to explore alongside him through his hyper-intimate books, sound editions, visual art and captivating performances - from groundbreaking sound collaborations with Andy Votel, Sean Canty, and Matt Krefting to his audacious attempt to complete the legendary filmmaker Luis BuÃ±uelâ€™s project of creating a bullet possessing such a weak charge that it would simply bounce off the filmmakerâ€™s shirt when fired at him.</p>
<p>Rick Myers has graced solo exhibitions at The National Poetry Library at Southbank Centre and Printed Matter, and he has performed and screened videos at institutions such MoMA Library and Whitechapel Gallery while his artist books and interdisciplinary project archives are part of the permanent collections at Library of Congress, Harvard University, MoMA, Tate Britain and many other prestigious institutions.</p>

<h2>Sosena Gebre Eyesus (ET)</h2>
<p>The begena, a 10 string Ethiopian bass lyre, is one of the worldâ€™s oldest and most beguiling instruments with an ambiguous origin story, why it also carries the name The Harp of David. Since ancient times it has been employed as an aural balm and a soother of evil, anxious spirits to calm them down.</p> 
<p>Sosena Gebre Eyesus is one of the most enthralling practitioners of the begena, with her trance-inducing harp playing, which found its way to a stunning album released by Little Ax Records in 2018. Accompanied by the low, buzzing strings, Eyesus performs her devotional Ethiopian hymns with a soft, soothing and utterly beautiful voice filling the void between the World of the living and the dead. Extremely rare in concert this is not to be missed!</p>
