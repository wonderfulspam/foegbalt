<h2>Sons of Set (PL/MA)</h2>
<p>Sons of Set is a brand new project by FoEG longtimer Raphael Rogiński who tirelessly digs deep into traditional musical cultures from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. He’s previously worked with Jewish culture and music, the Kurpie folklore (with the band Żywizna), the music of Henry Purcell, John Coltrane and much much more, and most recently he’s been on the path of trance music with projects like Hizbut Jámm. </p>
<p>Sons of Set is the next incarnation on this path where Rogiński teams up with Morrocan guitarist and guembri player Mustapha El Boudani. El Boudani, an indigenous Nomad from the village of M'Hamid El Ghizalne, which lies at the gates of the sands of the Sahara, sings in the Hassani language and brings with him the traditions of Gnawa music. Drummer Paweł Szpura (of Polish band Lotto) rounds out the trio. Sons of Set play the music of the desert and refer to traditional songs and melodies, but in welding together their different cultures, they create their very own personal trance-based music.
