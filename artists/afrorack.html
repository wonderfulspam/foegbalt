       <p>Afrorack is the moniker of Ugandan producer and DIY synth builder Brian Bamanya. Bamanya got interested in electronic music and wanted to make his own music based on local musical genres. As music gear from Europe and America was very expensive, and since it was also created to support genres from this part of the world, Bamanya decided to make his own synthesizer based on instructions he found on the internet. This resulted in the creation of ‘The Afrorack’ - the first ever African DIY modular synthesizer, which also allows creating music with the different scales and polyrhythms used in East African music.</p>
<p>The result is more or less stunning with Bamanya playfully taking on genres like acid and techno with a distinct flavor of East African harmonies and rhythms while there are also nods to history and the early pioneers of electronic music, like the German Krautrock scene of the early 70’s. </p>
<p>The Afrorack is also the name of Bamanya’s debut album released earlier this year on the Hakuna Kulala label -  a sub label of Nyege Nyege Tapes - and the album is, hands down, one of the most interesting electronic releases this year showcasing Bamanya’s mastery of the machine he built. Not to be missed! </p>
