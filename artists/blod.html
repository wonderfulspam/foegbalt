<h2>Blod (SE)</h2>
<p>Blod is Gustaf Dicksson's, member of Enhet För Fri Musik and one of the two owners of Discreet Music, solo vehicle. Is it a concept band? Perhaps. There seems to be common threads, at least, running through the nine full lengths Blod has labored so far: A thematic preoccupation with coming of age in the late 70s/early 80s, Folkhemmet, and further-left socialism in a distinctly Swedish/Scandinavian context is generally reflected in both artwork and song and album titles. These themes are conjured up by relatively sparse instrumentation – mainly guitar, flute, and keys/organ – on melodic, mostly wordless tracks. That these themes are only contextually implied in the music coupled with Blod's ability to weave familiar, but original, motifs into his music bestow it with a strong evocative quality. Off the top of our heads, we cannot think of any other music which, to the same degree as Blod, is the sound of remembrance. While the earlier work at times, perhaps, felt somewhat roughly outlined, which was only part of its charm, everything seemed to come together on this year's Missväxt, which sees Blod aided by Loopsel and Danish Astrid Øster Mortensen. The closing track, Danmark Frit, is in the running for our favorite track of the year. You do not want to miss this.</p>
