<h2>Jaleh Negari (DK/IR)</h2>
<p>Jaleh Negari is an Iranian/Danish composer and drummer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Negari works in the field of experimental instrumental- and vocal music, electronic music, percussion and sound art. She has been a key figure in the experimental scene in Copenhagen for more than a decade, exploring her practice as a composer and drummer with a vitality like few others. Her work is incredibly versatile and spans from hip hop groups to performance setups, experimental noise acts and avant-garde composition.</p>
<p>Jaleh Negari appears as a member of the bands Selvhenter and Pinkunoizu and as a part of the dance- and sound performance group Meshes. She is also a founding member of the artist collective and label Eget Værelse (eng: A Room Of One’s Own) along with fellow artists Maria Bertel, Sonja LaBianca, Maria Diekmann and Anja Jakobsen, which has become a platform for acts like Selvhenter, Valby Vokalgruppe and the solo projects of the members.</p>
<p>In 2021 Jaleh Negari released her second solo album Weaver ~, unfolding her work with electronic composition through musical translations of field recordings from travels in Denmark, Indonesia and Iran.</p>
