<h2>BLUE LAKE (US/PL/SE/DK)</h2>
<p>Blue Lake started several years ago as a vessel for Jason Dunganâ€™s solo recordings and collaborations, based around an interest in the post-jazz improvised music of the 1970s and 80s, folk and new age music and instrument-building. After a discovery of a traditional zither in a Swedish loppis, Dungan began building a range of multi-string instruments, modeled on the zither but taking elements from the guitar, banjo and koto.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Dungan has recorded and performed solo as Blue Lake, releasing LPs and cassettes. Blue Lake has recently begun performing live with a larger group, which also includes Carolyn Goodwin, Maria Dybbroe, and Nicole Hogstrand. Blue Lake has performed solo or as a band at Momentum (Odense), Den Frie (Cph), Polychrome (Cph), and Menue (Cph).</p>
<p>For FoEG, Blue Lake will play as a quartet, performing a single piece of music that uses the zither as a conducting element to guide an extended improvisation, and the participants will be Jason Dungan (US) on a self-built zither and clarinet, Tomo Jacobson (PL) on upright bass and reeds, Pauline Hogstrand (SE) on viola, and Oliver Laumann (DK) on percussion.</p>
